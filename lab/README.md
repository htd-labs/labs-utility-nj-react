# React Components
In this lab, you will learn how to render a component on a site.
# Files to modify
You should modify only the App.tsx file, under the room directory. It is also worthwhile to check out the files under src/components/class-component, src/componenets/demo-component, and src/components/function-component, as these contain the components that will be rendered onto your site, and the syntax is valuable.
# Running the app
Run `npm install`. You may ignore any warnings or notifications provided after running the command. Then, run `npm start` to open the app in your browser.
